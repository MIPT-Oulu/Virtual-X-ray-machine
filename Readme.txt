In order to create virtual x-ray images, run GUI_main.py code, which will open the user interface.
Exe file is not included due to being too big in size in order to upload into github. Exe can be
produced using auto-py-to-exe in python following the next steps:

-Use GUI_main as the "script location"
-In the "Additional Files", add all files except the folders (3d models, images, arrows)
-In "Advanced" --> "add binary", add "_gvxrPython3"
-After the exe has been created, move the folders (3d models, images, arrows) into the exe folder
